- Categorization and Tags: Allow users to organize entries with categories and tags for easier management and filtering.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft blue (#A0D2EB) to convey trust and security, subtly nodding to the concept of digital vaults.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F4F8) for a clean, minimal, distraction-free background.
- Accent color: Muted green (#90EE90) for interactive elements and success indicators (like copy confirmation).
- Font: 'Inter', a sans-serif for clean and universal readability in both headings and body text.
- Use simple, outline-style icons for actions like 'copy', 'generate', and categories for easy recognition.
- Use a clean, card-based layout for entries with a clear visual hierarchy.
- Subtle animation on 'copy' action for visual confirmation (e.g., a brief color change or icon transformation).
